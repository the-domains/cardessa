**I'm Cardessa** - quintessential Gemini, detox champion & explorer of all things metaphysical.  I help seekers discover who they are, zero in on their purpose, and do stuff they care about.  Success on your own terms requires self-knowledge.  

In fact, knowledge of self is one of the most well-known commandments of the ancient world.  At the arc of Apollo at Dephi, you'll find the charge: "KNOW THYSELF"...but no further instruction is given. So how do you go about doing that exactly?  

If you're anything like me, you're a complex creature, and getting to know yourself can be a lifelong pursuit.  You may have spent time investigating all the different dimensions of you, your personality type, your strengths, yet you're still grasping for the essence of what makes you YOU. It's frustrating. How can you not know your own self?

KNOW THYSELF. They make it sound so simple, like a box to check. I think you'd agree that it's definitely not as easy as the short command suggests.  I've been seeking the answers to this puzzling challenge my whole adult life, and have found some tools to help navigate the deep waters of the self.  I'll be sharing my findings in upcoming posts. 

What have you found valuable on your quest for self-knowledge? I'd love to hear the methods and tools you've found to understand your personality and  define your purpose.

Namaste,

CKerr
